# Table Teacher Assistant
## Target
This project will create a useful table teacher assistant by using LLMs, Stable Diffusion and some other techs. This project can achieve:
- Display a character of your choice on the screen to communicate with you and can also generate voice.
- Upload your lessons' files and LLM can answer your questions from the files.
- It goes into sleep mode when not in use and activates when you look at it.
